# DSA Thinking

If your DSA solution feels complex,
you probably skipped one step:
**understanding the pattern.**

Before writing code, pause and ask:
- Is this prefix / suffix?
- Can two pointers solve this?
- Do I need recursion with memoization?
- Is this greedy or DP?

Patterns reduce thinking cost.
That’s the real power of DSA.

This repository focuses on **how to think**
before writing code.
