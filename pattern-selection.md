# Pattern Selection Before Coding

Most DSA problems feel hard not because they are complex,
but because we jump into implementation too early.

Before coding, answer these questions:

## 1. What changes when input size grows?
If the same subproblem repeats → think **recursion + memoization**.

## 2. Is the data ordered or can it be ordered?
If yes → **two pointers** often apply.

## 3. Are we asked for ranges or cumulative values?
Think **prefix / suffix**.

## 4. Can a local optimal choice guarantee global optimality?
If yes → **greedy**.
If not → **dynamic programming**.

Choosing the right pattern simplifies the solution
before a single line of code is written.
